### What is it

A kit consisting of Raspberry Pi's, sound sensors, and software that tracks sound levels which match those of abnormally high volume. The system is designed to automatically store sound values within a database, graphing, photos, and also has functionality which can approximate the origin when more than one device is implemented on premises.

### Why

The purpose is to provide an affordable, easy to implement device which can be utilized by entities that may not have the funding to purchase adequate security devices to monitor instances of increased activity in the area.
